        Here we demonstrate the Observable.combineLatest() method that will combine events from two different observables.\n\nWe create two observables from the two text views and create a third that combines them and updated the view below.

    <string name="RXRetrofitFragment">
        Here we demonstrate Retrofit and RX working together. Retrofit will return an Observable from the REST call which is then used to update a RecyclerView.\n\nWe have ensured that the Retrofit call is running on a parallel thread and the result is obtained on the main thread so we can update a view.\nYou can click the button many times to see this effect.
